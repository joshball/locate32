<P><A NAME="howto_externaldrives"></A><B>How to index network drives, USB memory sticks, etc...</B></P><p></p>By default, only local drives are included into databases. You can also index nonlocal drives, such as network drives or USB memory sticks. To do that:<ul><li>open Settings dialog and select Databases tab,</li><li>select a database which you want to include the content of the drive and press Edit or create a new database,</li><li>choose "Custom" check box, and</li><li>use "Add Directory" button to add the drives and directories to the list of drivers and directories.</li></ul></p><p>You may want to choose "Stop if root unavailable". If this option is not chosen and a drive (e.g.,  network share) is unavailable the database is updated, this drive is just skipped causing that the content of the drive is removed from the database.</p>
