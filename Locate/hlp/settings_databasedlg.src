A file name can contain "%locatedir%" which is the same as the Locate32's directory. For example,

"C:\Program Files\Locate" directory.

<p>
<b><A NAME="sdd_unicode"></A>Use Unicode character set</b>:
If this option is enabled, filenames are stored using Unicode character set.

If this option is enabled and the database is updated, the database file is not overwritten and the 
content of scanned drives is added to the tail of database.

database containing all files in several discs, setup a database containing CD/
DVD rom drive and enable this option, insert a disc to drive and update database, insert another disc 
and update database again).
